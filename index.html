    <h3>About</h3>
     <p>I'd say I'm a cross between a nerd, a snowboard bum, and an artist. My current goal in life is to build a career where I can travel and live anywhere I please. Right now I think coding may be the best way for me to do this. I've been studying Engineering Science at The Pennsylvania State University since 2011, taking multiple leaves of study to work compelling jobs, pursue alternative means of education, and have grand adventures along the way. Some of my experiences include:
       <ul>
         <li>tricking out a cargo van and driving it across the country</li> 
         <li>spending a month in Toas, NM learning to build <a href="http://earthship.com">sustainable homes</a></li>
         <li>volunteering on organic farms in Yucatan, Mexico</li>
         <li>immersing myself in a <a href="https://www.uncollege.org">self-directed learning program</a></li>
           <li>earning my Level 1 Snowboard Instructor certification</li> 
         <li>working as a <a href="http://myoutsidein.org">mentor for at-risk youth</a></li></ul></p>

  <h1>Music</h1>
      <div class="musicbio"><p>I started writing lyrics in the fall of 2010. The following year I got a Macbook Pro for college that came with Garageband and started making really crummy beats. As college progressed I purchased Pro Tools along with some recording equipment and started making songs with friends that were a little less terrible. Now I make music that's kind of ok.  </p></div>
